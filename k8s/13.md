I have 3 replicas of my app, for example. Then, if I go to web-site root several times, and try to cat visits, here is the output



```bash=
?  k8s (master) ? kubectl exec -it app-python-0 -- cat /opt/data/visits.json

The output is different on different pods because of load balancing which we configured on the previous



### Describe and explain in the report the differences between the output of the command for replicas.


As we can see, the contents of visits file is different on all there `cat`'s. This is because of different persistent volume chain for every pods. In the configuration, I've provided only the template for the PVC, and then kubernetes created a different chain for every pods.


### For our app ordering guarantee are unnecessary. Describe in the report why. Then find a way to tell to the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel. Implement it.

The only pods we have is replicas of simple python application. The replicas don't communicate with each other, so no dependency on staring order. However, if we would have a `mysql` pod, then we can't load the python app when database is not ready. In this case, we should ensure that database is healhy, and only then start the python application

If we want statefulset to start pods in parallel (and this is the preffered way when there is not dependency on start order), we can use `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"`

```bash=
?  k8s (master) ? kubectl get pods
NAME           READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
app-python-0   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
app-python-1   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
app-python-2   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
```
